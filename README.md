# cghs

An haskell way to do 2D computational geometry.

The library provides the following geometric types:

* points
* vectors
* segments
* triangles
* polygons
* circles

The following algorithms:

* none

It also contains a viewer written using `GLFW-b` and `OpenGL` bindings.It alllows users to easily manipulate geometric objects and apply algorithms.

The following functionalities are supported by the viewer:

* left-click for adding points
* right-click for selecting points
* 'r' to restore the initial state
* 'c' to apply the convex hull algorithm on the selected points
